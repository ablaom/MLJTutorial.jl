# Tutorial 3. Transformers and Pipelines

> **Goals:** Learn how to:
> 1. Apply common data preprocessing tasks using an MLJ **transformer**.
> 2. Combine a sequence of transformers with a supervised model in a single standalone model called a **pipelines**
> 3. Wrap a supervised model in transformations/inverse transformations of the target variable

To run the code in this tutorial in a live Julia session, first follow the instructions
given [here](@ref instructions).

### Transformers

Unsupervised models, which receive no target `y` during training, always have a
`transform` operation. They sometimes also support an `inverse_transform` operation,
with obvious meaning, and sometimes support a `predict` operation (see the clustering
example discussed
[here](https://juliaai.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/transformers/#Transformers-that-also-predict-1)).
Otherwise, they are handled much like supervised models.

Here's a simple standardization example:

````@julia
using MLJ

x = rand(100);
@show mean(x) std(x);
````

````
mean(x) = 0.49308016844176983
std(x) = 0.2752393968165335

````

````@julia
model = Standardizer() # a built-in model
mach = machine(model, x)
fit!(mach)
xhat = transform(mach, x);
@show mean(xhat) std(xhat);
````

````
[ Info: Training machine(Standardizer(features = Symbol[], …), …).
mean(xhat) = 9.103828801926283e-17
std(xhat) = 1.0

````

This particular model has an `inverse_transform`:

````@julia
inverse_transform(mach, xhat) ≈ x
````

````
true
````

### Re-encoding the King County House data as continuous

For further illustrations of transformers, let's re-encode *all* of the King County
House input features (see Exercise 3) into a set of `Continuous` features. We do this
with the `ContinuousEncoder` model, which, by default, will:

- one-hot encode all `Multiclass` features
- coerce all `OrderedFactor` features to `Continuous` ones
- coerce all `Count` features to `Continuous` ones (there aren't any)
- drop any remaining non-Continuous features (none of these either)

First, we reload the data and fix the scitypes (Exercise 3):

````@julia
import Downloads, CSV
import DataFrames
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ablaom/"*
    "MachineLearningInJulia2020/for-MLJ-version-0.16/"*
    "data/house.csv"
csv_file = Downloads.download(url)
house = CSV.read(csv_file, DataFrames.DataFrame)
coerce!(house, autotype(house))
coerce!(house, Count => Continuous, :zipcode => Multiclass)
schema(house)
````

Some commonly used ones are built-in (do not require `@load`ing):

model type                  | does what?
----------------------------|----------------------------------------------
ContinuousEncoder | transform input table to a table of `Continuous` features (see above)
FeatureSelector | retain or dump selected features
FillImputer | impute missing values
OneHotEncoder | one-hot encoder `Multiclass` (and optionally `OrderedFactor`) features
Standardizer | standardize (whiten) a vector or all `Continuous` features of a table
UnivariateBoxCoxTransformer | apply a learned Box-Cox transformation to a vector
UnivariateDiscretizer | discretize a `Continuous` vector, and hence render its elscitypw `OrderedFactor`

In addition to "dynamic" transformers (ones that learn something
from the data and must be `fit!`) users can wrap ordinary functions
as transformers, and such *static* transformers can depend on
parameters, like the dynamic ones. See
[here](https://juliaai.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/transformers/#Static-transformers-1)
for how to define your own static transformers.

### Pipelines

````@julia
length(schema(Xcont).names)
````

````
87
````

Let's suppose that additionally we'd like to reduce the dimension of
our data.  A model that will do this is `PCA` from
`MultivariateStats.jl`:

````@julia
PCA = @load PCA
reducer = PCA()
````

````
PCA(
  maxoutdim = 0, 
  method = :auto, 
  variance_ratio = 0.99, 
  mean = nothing)
````

Now, rather simply repeating the work-flow above, applying the new
transformation to `Xcont`, we can combine both the encoding and the
dimension-reducing models into a single model, known as a
*pipeline*. While MLJ offers a powerful interface for composing
models in a variety of ways, we'll stick to these simplest class of
composite models for now. The simplest way to construct a pipeline
is using the Julia's `|>` syntax:

````@julia
pipe = encoder |> reducer
````

````
UnsupervisedPipeline(
  continuous_encoder = ContinuousEncoder(
        drop_last = false, 
        one_hot_ordered_factors = false), 
  pca = PCA(
        maxoutdim = 0, 
        method = :auto, 
        variance_ratio = 0.99, 
        mean = nothing), 
  cache = true)
````

Notice that the model `pipe` has other models as hyperparameters
(with names automatically generated based on the mode type
name). The hyperparameters of the component models are are now
*nested*, but we can still access them:

````@julia
@show pipe.pca.variance_ratio
````

````
0.99
````

````@julia
pipe.pca.variance_ratio = 0.9995
````

````
0.9995
````

The pipeline model behaves like any other transformer:

````@julia
mach = machine(pipe, X)
fit!(mach)
Xsmall = transform(mach, X)
schema(Xsmall)
````

````
┌───────┬────────────┬─────────┐
│ names │ scitypes   │ types   │
├───────┼────────────┼─────────┤
│ x1    │ Continuous │ Float64 │
│ x2    │ Continuous │ Float64 │
│ x3    │ Continuous │ Float64 │
└───────┴────────────┴─────────┘

````

Want to combine this pre-processing with ridge regression?

````@julia
RidgeRegressor = @load RidgeRegressor pkg=MLJLinearModels
rgs = RidgeRegressor()
pipe2 = pipe |> rgs
````

````
DeterministicPipeline(
  continuous_encoder = ContinuousEncoder(
        drop_last = false, 
        one_hot_ordered_factors = false), 
  pca = PCA(
        maxoutdim = 0, 
        method = :auto, 
        variance_ratio = 0.9995, 
        mean = nothing), 
  ridge_regressor = RidgeRegressor(
        lambda = 1.0, 
        fit_intercept = true, 
        penalize_intercept = false, 
        scale_penalty_with_samples = true, 
        solver = nothing), 
  cache = true)
````

Now our pipeline is a supervised model, instead of a transformer,
whose performance we can evaluate:

````@julia
mach = machine(pipe2, X, y)
evaluate!(mach, measure=mae, resampling=Holdout()) # `CV(nfolds=6)` is `resampling` default
````

````
PerformanceEvaluation object with these fields:
  model, tag, measure, operation,
  measurement, uncertainty_radius_95, per_fold, per_observation,
  fitted_params_per_fold, report_per_fold,
  train_test_rows, resampling, repeats
Tag: DeterministicPipeline-446
Extract:
┌──────────┬───────────┬─────────────┐

│   p = 1) │           │             │
└──────────┴───────────┴─────────────┘

````

### Training of composite models is "smart"

Now notice what happens if we train on all the data, then change a
regressor hyperparameter and retrain:

````@julia
fit!(mach);
````

````
[ Info: Training machine(DeterministicPipeline(continuous_encoder = ContinuousEncoder(drop_last = false, …), …), …).
[ Info: Training machine(:continuous_encoder, …).
[ Info: Training machine(:pca, …).
[ Info: Training machine(:ridge_regressor, …).
┌ Info: Solver: MLJLinearModels.Analytical
│   iterative: Bool false
└   max_inner: Int64 200

````

````@julia
pipe2.ridge_regressor.lambda = 0.1
fit!(mach);
````

````
[ Info: Updating machine(DeterministicPipeline(continuous_encoder = ContinuousEncoder(drop_last = false, …), …), …).
[ Info: Not retraining machine(:continuous_encoder, …). Use `force=true` to force.
[ Info: Not retraining machine(:pca, …). Use `force=true` to force.
[ Info: Updating machine(:ridge_regressor, …).
┌ Info: Solver: MLJLinearModels.Analytical
│   iterative: Bool false
└   max_inner: Int64 200

````

Second time only the ridge regressor is retrained!

Mutate a hyperparameter of the `PCA` model and every model except
the `ContinuousEncoder` (which comes before it will be retrained):

````@julia
pipe2.pca.variance_ratio = 0.9999
fit!(mach);
````

````
[ Info: Updating machine(DeterministicPipeline(continuous_encoder = ContinuousEncoder(drop_last = false, …), …), …).
[ Info: Not retraining machine(:continuous_encoder, …). Use `force=true` to force.
[ Info: Updating machine(:pca, …).
[ Info: Training machine(:ridge_regressor, …).
┌ Info: Solver: MLJLinearModels.Analytical
│   iterative: Bool false
└   max_inner: Int64 200

````

### Inspecting composite models

The dot syntax used above to change the values of *nested*
hyperparameters is also useful when inspecting the learned
parameters and report generated when training a composite model:

````@julia
fitted_params(mach).ridge_regressor
````

````
(coefs = [:x1 => -0.7328956348620362, :x2 => -0.16590563197071073, :x3 => 194.59514735965914, :x4 => 102.7129805185524], intercept = 540088.1417665293)
````

````@julia
report(mach).pca

### Incorporating target transformations

Next, suppose that instead of using the raw `:price` as the training target, we want to
use the log-price (a common practice in dealing with house price data). However, suppose
that we still want to report final *predictions* on the original linear scale (and use
these for evaluation purposes). Then we wrap our supervised model using
`TransformedTargetModel`, which has two keyword arguments `transformer` and `inverse`.

````@julia
rgs_log = TransformedTargetModel(rgs, transformer=y->log.(y), inverse=z->exp.(z))
````

````
TransformedTargetModelDeterministic(
  model = RidgeRegressor(
        lambda = 0.1, 
        fit_intercept = true, 
        penalize_intercept = false, 
        scale_penalty_with_samples = true, 
        solver = nothing), 
  transformer = Main.var"##277".var"#6#7"(), 
  inverse = Main.var"##277".var"#8#9"(), 
  cache = true)
````

And here is a revised pipeline model:

````@julia
pipe3 = pipe |> rgs_log
mach = machine(pipe3, X, y)
evaluate!(mach, measure=mae)
````

````

  measurement, uncertainty_radius_95, per_fold, per_observation,
  fitted_params_per_fold, report_per_fold,

MLJ will also allow you to insert *learned* target transformations. For example, we
might want to apply `Standardizer()` to the target, to standardize it, or
`UnivariateBoxCoxTransformer()` to make it look Gaussian. Then instead of specifying a
*function* for `target`, we specify a unsupervised *model* (or model type). One does not
specify `inverse` because only models implementing `inverse_transform` are allowed.

Let's see which of these two options results in a better outcome:

````@julia
box = UnivariateBoxCoxTransformer(n=20)
stand = Standardizer()

rgs_box = TransformedTargetModel(rgs, transformer=box)
pipe4 = pipe |> rgs_box
mach = machine(pipe4, X, y)
evaluate!(mach, measure=mae)

(a) Define a pipeline that:
- uses `Standardizer` to ensure that features that are already
  continuous are centered at zero and have unit variance
- re-encodes the full set of features as `Continuous`, using
  `ContinuousEncoder`
- uses the `KMeans` clustering model from `Clustering.jl`
  to reduce the dimension of the feature space to `k=10`.
- trains a `EvoTreeClassifier` (a gradient tree boosting
  algorithm in `EvoTrees.jl`) on the reduced data, using
  `nrounds=50` and default values for the other
   hyperparameters

(b) Evaluate the pipeline on all data, using 6-fold cross-validation
and `cross_entropy` loss.

(c) Plot a learning curve which examines the effect on this loss
as the tree booster parameter `max_depth` varies from 2 to 10.
