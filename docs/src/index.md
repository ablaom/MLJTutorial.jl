# [MLJTutorial.jl](@id home)

Tutorials for introducing the machine learning toolbox [MLJ](https://juliaml.ai) (Machine
Learning in Julia)

Two collections of tutorials are hosted here:

- Tutorials for use with the *Using MLJ* series of instructional videos
- The original, but updated, *MLJTutorial* series, part of a 3.5 hour [online
  workshop](https://github.com/ablaom/MachineLearningInJulia2020) delivered in 2020.


## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic data manipulation in Julia: vectors, tuples, dictionaries,
  arrays, generating random numbers, tabular data (e.g., DataDrames.jl) basic linear
  algebra and statistics.
  
- Familiarity with [Julia package management](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/)

- Familiarity with Machine Learning fundamentals and best practice.

## [Running tutorial code for yourself](@id instructions)

You can find the annotated Julia scripts from which tutorials are generated in [these
directories](https://github.com/ablaom/MLJTutorial.jl/tree/dev/docs/src/notebooks). Package
environment files for this repository are structured using Julia's package workspaces. To
use with Julia 1.12 or later:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your computer

2. In a terminal window change your directory to the root of the clone.

3. From that terminal, launch julia (preferably with the `--startup-file=no` switch) and run `using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate(workspace=true)`. This resolves a valid set of package for all the tutorials, downloads package code to your computer, and carries out some precompilation. This may take a few minutes. You need carry out this step only once.

3. Activate the project for the particular tutorial of interest (as specified by Project.toml file in the corresponding directory).
   
4. Execute code blocks copied from the rendered tutorial (as linked above) or from the corresponding .jl script.


## More about the tutorials 

- The tutorials focus on the *machine learning* part of the data
  science workflow, and less on exploratory data analysis and other
  conventional "data analytics" methodology

- Here "machine learning" is meant in a broad sense, and is not
  restricted to so-called *deep learning* (neural networks)

- The tutorials are crafted to rapidly familiarize the user with what
  MLJ can do and how to do it, and are not a substitute for a course
  on machine learning fundamentals. Examples do not necessarily
  represent best practice or the best solution to a problem.
